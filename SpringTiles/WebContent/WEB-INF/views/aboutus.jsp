					<p>During our initial interaction with Organic Players, we noticed two things. First, there were a lot of really good organic products, but they were limited in terms of reach and availability. Second, it was often difficult to understand why a product was organic. .</p>
					<p>As are result, we started ipuroorganic.com, which makes easy for customers/buyers to buy organic products from anywhere in India and developed Standard process in identifying certified organic products. </p>
					
					<p>Our single focus is to bring the very best organic and green products to consumers and the marketplace. We believe every product should be Eco and people friendly. While there is much to be done to achieve this goal, we are working hard to be an integral part of this important transformation. Our mission is to be the most trusted source for green products. We hope you agree and will support a better future. </p>
